            <h2>What is Competency?</h2>
            <p>
                Competence is the set of demonstrable characteristics and skills that enable, and improve the efficiency of,
                performance of a job. The term "competence" first appeared in an article authored by R.W.
                White in 1959 as a concept for performance motivation. In 1970, Craig C.
                <br>Lundberg defined the concept in "Planning the Executive Development Program".
                The term gained traction when in 1973, David McClelland wrote a seminal paper entitled,
                "Testing for Competence Rather Than for Intelligence". It has since been popularized by Richard Boyatzis and many others,
                such as T.F. Gilbert (1978) who used the concept in relationship to performance improvement. Its use varies widely, which leads to considerable misunderstanding.

            <h2>Who are we?</h2>
            <p>
                 We are the Competency indicators who identify specific aspects of a competency that are transferable across subject areas or contexts.
                Educators may use one or more indicators to identify situations that develop a particular competency.
